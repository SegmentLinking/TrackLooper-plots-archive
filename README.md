# TrackLooper plots archive

![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/segmentlinking/tracklooper-plots-archive)

This repository is used as an archive for plots made by the CI workflow for each pull request of the [SegmentLinking/TrackLooper](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/TrackLooper) repository. It aims to permanently store validation and comparison plots, so that it is easier to keep track of progress and look back in cases when it is found that a PR introduced an issue.

The plots produced by the CI in [SegmentLinking/cmssw](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/cmssw) can be found in the [cmssw branch](https://github.com/SegmentLinking/TrackLooper-plots-archive/tree/cmssw).

The contents of this repository should not be modified manually, as the entire process is designed to be fully automated.
